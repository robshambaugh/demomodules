# Includes
#
# Additional configuration can be provided through includes.
# One advantage of include files is that if they are updated upstream, the changes affect all pipelines using that include.
#
# Includes can be overridden by re-declaring anything provided in an include, here in gitlab-ci.yml
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/includes.html#override-included-configuration-values

  # DrupalCI includes:
